# Typed Report Contracts

The report schema is now represented by provisional typed Pydantic contracts. The contracts define serialization semantics for later stages, but no report writer or audit pipeline is operational yet.

## Planned output files

- `report.json`: future machine-readable serialization of `AuditReport`.
- `report.html`: future human-readable rendering from `AuditReport`.
- `findings.csv`: future tabular export of factual and evaluated findings.
- `repair_proposal.csv`: future export of `RepairProposal`, generated only with `--repair`.

## Top-level `AuditReport` fields

- `schema_version`: literal `1.0.0`.
- `tool`: `ToolMetadata` with tool name and package version.
- `run`: `RunMetadata` with run ID, timezone-aware timestamps, and command tuple.
- `inputs`: `InputSummary` with source manifest summaries, optional image root, and total record count.
- `configuration`: `AuditConfig`, including deterministic configuration digest behavior.
- `policy`: `SplitPolicy`, beginning with `patient_independent_pathology_benchmark`.
- `schema_mapping`: optional `SchemaMapping` with per-field provenance.
- `summary`: `FindingSummary`.
- `factual_findings`: immutable sequence of `FactualFinding` detector-stage records without policy outcomes.
- `evaluated_findings`: immutable sequence of `EvaluatedFinding` records with `PolicyOutcome` and policy reason.
- `relationship_graph`: `RelationshipGraph` serialization contract.
- `policy_evaluation`: `PolicyEvaluationSummary`.
- `repair_proposal`: optional `RepairProposal` requiring researcher review.
- `reproducibility`: `ReproducibilityMetadata`.
- `warnings`: immutable warning strings.

## Contract status

The typed models prohibit arbitrary extra fields and use immutable tuples where practical. Serialization is deterministic when callers provide canonical ordering. Later stages may add report writers and typed model migrations, but they must preserve the factual-versus-evaluated finding distinction.
